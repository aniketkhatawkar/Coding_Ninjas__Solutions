Problem :- Vaccination Drive

Problem statement
The Indian government recently launched the world's largest vaccination drive for COVID-19. 
Dr Ritesh has been appointed as a nodal officer for vaccinating a locality. 
There are ‘N’ houses numbers from 1 to ‘N’ in that locality. Dr Ritesh will visit each house one by one and vaccinate all the people in the house. 
He has already covered ‘K’ number of houses. Since ‘N’ is a very large number, ‘L’ bits are required to represent the number. 
You are supposed to help Dr Ritesh and find the maximum possible number of houses that are yet to be covered under the vaccination drive.
