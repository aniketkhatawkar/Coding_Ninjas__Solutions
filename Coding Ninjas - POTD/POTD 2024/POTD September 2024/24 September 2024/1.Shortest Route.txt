Shortest Route

Problem statement
You want to visit your friend’s house who lives at some location in an infinite grid. You are initially at the origin of the infinite grid and can move only in four directions (i.e East, West, North, South).

For Example, If you are at cell (X, Y) then you can move to East i.e at cell (X+1, Y), or West i.e at cell (X-1, Y), or North i.e at cell (X, Y+1), or South i.e at cell (X, Y-1).

Your friend gives you a string ‘STR’ of length ‘N’ that represents the route to his house from the origin. The string ‘STR’ has only four different characters, i.e ‘E’, ‘W’, ‘N’, ‘S’. which represent direction East, West, North, South, respectively.

You find out that the route given by your friend is very long, and a shorter route is also possible. Your task is to find the smallest route to reach your friend’s house. See the example for better clarity.

Note:

1. There can be more than one shortest route, you should return the one which is lexicographically smallest among them.
Example:

Consider that your friend’s house is in the cell (2, 1) in the grid. And the route given by your friend is represented by the string ‘STR’= “NNSEWEE”.

One of the smallest route to reach cell (2, 1) from origin i.e cell (0, 0) is given by string  “EEN”  i.e you start from the cell (0, 0), then move East, i.e at cell (1, 0), then again move East, i.e at cell (2, 0), and then finally move North i.e at cell (2, 1).

Note, there are some other smallest routes such as “NEE”,  “ENE” etc, but “EEN” is the lexicographically smallest among them, so you should return it.
