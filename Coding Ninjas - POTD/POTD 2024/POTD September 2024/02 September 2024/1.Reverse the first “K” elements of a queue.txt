Reverse the first “K” elements of a queue

Problem statement
You have been given a queue and an integer ‘K’. 
You need to reverse the order of the first ‘K’ elements of the queue.

Note :
The relative order of other elements should be maintained.
For example :
If Q = [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 ]
and ‘K’ = 4 
then the output will be
Q = [ 40, 30, 20, 10, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
