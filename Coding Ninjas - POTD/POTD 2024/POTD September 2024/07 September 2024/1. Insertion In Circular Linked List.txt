Insertion In Circular Linked List

Problem statement
You are given a circular singly linked list, 
where every node in the linked list contains a pointer 'next' which points to the next node in the list, 
and the last node points to the head of the list.

All nodes have some positive integer value 'data' associated with them.
Your task is to insert a new node with 'data' equal to 'val' in the linked list at a given position 'k'.

Note:
The position given will always be less than or equal to the length of the linked list. Assume all the indexing starts from '0'.


Example:
Input : 'k' = 1, 'val' = 5, 'list' = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: 1 5 2 3 4
