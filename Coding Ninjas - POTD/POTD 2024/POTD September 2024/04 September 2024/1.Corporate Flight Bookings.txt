Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
For the first test case,
Flight labels:               1   2   3   4
Booking 1 reserved:          3   3
Booking 2 reserved:              2   2
Booking 3 reserved:          1   1   1
Booking 4 reserved:                  2   2    
Total seats:                 4   6   5   2
Hence, answer = [4, 6, 5, 2].

For the second test case, there is only one flight and single booking detail. So, answer = [7].
