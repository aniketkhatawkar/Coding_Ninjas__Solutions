String Without 000 Or 111

Problem statement
You have to create any binary string ‘S’ of length ‘M+N’ which has exactly ‘M’ 0’s and ‘N’ 1’s. 
S can not have ‘111’ or ‘000’ as a substring.

Given ‘M’ and ‘N’ it is guaranteed that there exists at least one binary string ‘S’.

The substring of a string is obtained by deleting characters from the start and end of the string.

For example:
M = 6, N = 6
ANS = “110011001100”

In ans no three consecutive characters are same. 
ANS=”001100110011” is also a valid answer.
