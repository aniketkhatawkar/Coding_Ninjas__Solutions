Rearrange Sentences

Problem statement
You are given an array of ‘N’ sentences. Each sentence is a space-delimited string of words. 
The first word in each sentence is an alphanumeric identifier. 
Then, at least one of the following conditions will hold true:

1. After identifier, each word will consist only of lowercase English letters
2. After the identifier, each word will consist only of numbers.
We will call these two types of sentences, letter – sentence and number– sentence. 
It is guaranteed that each sentence has at least one word after its identifier. 
Your task is to sort these sentences such that the following two conditions will hold.

1. All letter - sentences must come before number- sentences.
2. The letter - sentences must be ordered lexicographically ignoring identifiers. 
The identifier will be used in case of ties.
3. The number– sentence must be put in their original order of occurrence.
