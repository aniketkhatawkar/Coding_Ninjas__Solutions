Longest Mountain Subarray

Problem statement
You are given an array of 'N' integers denoting the heights of the mountains. 
You need to find the length of the longest subarray which has the shape of a mountain.

A mountain subarray is defined as a subarray which consists of elements that are initially in ascending order until a peak element is reached and beyond the peak element all other elements of the subarray are in decreasing order.

Example:
If the given array is: [1 3 1 4]. The longest mountain subarray would be 3. This is because the longest mountain is  [1 3 1] having length 3.
