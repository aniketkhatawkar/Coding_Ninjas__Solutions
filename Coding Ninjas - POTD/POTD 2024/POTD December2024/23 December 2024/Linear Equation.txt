Linear Equation

Problem statement
Ninja has been given an assignment by his teacher. He has been given three integers ‘a’,’b’, and ‘c’ which represent the coefficients of the equation “ax + by = c”. His task is to find the initial integral solution of the given equation if a finite solution exists.

For example:

If ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’ are 5, 10, and 10 respectively, the initial integral solution will be 2 and 0 for ‘x’ and ‘y’ respectively.
