Periodic String

Problem statement
Given a string ‘S’ find whether the given string is periodic or not.

A string is said to be periodic if it repeats itself after a certain number of characters and the period of repetition is less than the size of the string.

For example: Let ‘S’ be “ababab” we can clearly see that this string is periodic as ‘ab’ is repeated 3 times to make the string ‘S’.
