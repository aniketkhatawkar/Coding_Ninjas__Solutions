Average Marks

Problem statement
You are given the name of a student in the form of a character ‘firstLetterOfName’ and 3 integers ‘M1’, ‘M2’, ‘M3’ representing the marks of the student in 3 subjects. You have to print the ‘firstLetterOfName’ of the student and the average marks obtained by the student.

Note: You need to print the integer part of the average only and neglect the decimal part.

For Example :
If ‘firstLetterOfName’ = ‘K’, ‘M1’ = 10, ‘M2’ = 6 and ‘M3’ = 9, then the average marks would be around 7.67. Hence, the output should be as follows:
