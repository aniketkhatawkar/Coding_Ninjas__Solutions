Evaluation of postfix expression

Problem statement
An expression is called the postfix expression if the operator appears in the expression after the operands.

Example :

Infix expression: A + B  *  C - D 

Postfix expression:  A B + C D - *
Given a postfix expression, the task is to evaluate the expression. The answer could be very large, output your answer modulo (10^9+7). Also, 
use modular division when required.

Note:
1. Operators will only include the basic arithmetic operators like '*', '/', '+', and '-'.

2. The operand can contain multiple digits. 

3. The operators and operands will have space as a separator between them.

4. There wonâ€™t be any brackets in the postfix expression.
