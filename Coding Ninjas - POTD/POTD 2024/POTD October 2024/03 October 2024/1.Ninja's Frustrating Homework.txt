Ninja's Frustrating Homework

Problem statement
Ninja got a summer vacation homework in which he got a booklet containing a very long string and some set of words written in his diary for which he had to search all these words in that string booklet.

His teacher asked him to write all the starting indices for all the words written in the diary after searching that from the string booklet.

Ninja finds this work very frustrating. He tries to find some help from his neighbor and currently, you are the one who is his neighbor.

It is very time consuming to find every word in the string booklet manually. So you decide to design a code for that. Help Ninja!

Note :

Follow 0 based indexing. 
Print the indices in sorted order.
