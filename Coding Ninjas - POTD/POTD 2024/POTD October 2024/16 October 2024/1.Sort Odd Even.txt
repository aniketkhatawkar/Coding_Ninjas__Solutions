Sort Odd Even

Problem statement
You are given a 0-indexed array ‘NUMS’ consisting of ‘N’ integers. Sort the array ‘NUMS’ in such a way that the first half of the array contains only odd numbers sorted in non-increasing order and the second half contains only even numbers sorted in non-decreasing order.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 4,  ‘NUMS’ = [2, 5, 3, 6] 

Output: [5, 3, 2, 6]

Sorting the odd numbers of the array ‘NUMS’ in non-increasing order, the result is 5, 3
Then, Sorting the even numbers in non-decreasing order, the result is 2, 6.
Since the final array should contain the odd numbers in non-increasing order in the first half and even numbers in non-decreasing order in the other half.
So, the final array is [5, 3, 2, 6].
