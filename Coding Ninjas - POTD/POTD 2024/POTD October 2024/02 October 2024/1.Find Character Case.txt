Find Character Case

Problem statement
You are given a character ‘CH’ as input, 
return either 1, 0 or -1 according to the following rules:

1, if the character is an uppercase alphabet (A - Z).

0, if the character is a lowercase alphabet (a - z).

-1, if the character is not an alphabet.

For Example :
If ‘CH’ = ‘a’, then since it is a lowercase letter, your program should return 0.
