Reverse A Doubly Linked List

Problem statement
You are given a doubly-linked list of size 'N', 
consisting of positive integers. Now your task is to reverse it and return the head of the modified list.



Note:
A doubly linked list is a kind of linked list that is bidirectional, 
meaning it can be traversed in both forward and backward directions.
Example:

Input: 
4
4 3 2 1

This means you have been given doubly linked list of size 4 = 4 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 1.

Output: 
1 2 3 4

This means after reversing the doubly linked list it becomes 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4.
