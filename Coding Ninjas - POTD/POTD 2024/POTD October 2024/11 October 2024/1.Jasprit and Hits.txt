Jasprit and Hits

Problem statement
Jasprit loves playing cricket. He wants to be a part of the Indian cricket team and become the best pacer for India. 
So he started practicing every day and took guidance from his coach. Every day to measure how he is improving, he maintained the count of times he hits the stumps in a day.

‘N’ days have been passed and its track is denoted by the array ‘ARR’, and to track his improvement, his coach will also ask him the average count of hits of stumps per day for a particular range of days (i.e. ‘L’ to ‘R’) to him. Meanwhile, he will also add the count of time he hits the stumps in the ongoing days.

Jasprit is not very good at maths, So being his friend he asked you to help him to add the count of times he hit the stumps in the day as well as give the average count of hits of stumps per day for a particular range of days asked by his coach.

There will be a ‘Q’ number of such queries where each query will be either one of the following types:

1) Add the stumps hit by Jasprit i.e. ‘X’ to the array ‘ARR’, denoted by query number ‘1’.

2) Give the average of hits of stumps per day for days ranging from ‘[L, R]’ asked by his coach denoted by query number ‘2’.

Can you help him with this problem?.

NOTE: The average here means the sum of all elements in the selected range divided by the number of elements rounded down, i.e. let's suppose ‘sum’ = 10 and ‘number of elements’ = 4, then the average will be = 10/4 = 2.5, which when rounded down gives 2.

The array ‘ARR’ is 0-based indexing and queries of type 2 are represented in 1-based indexing.

The answer to the query of type 2 will be rounded down to an integer.

EXAMPLE :
Input: ‘N’ = 2, ‘Q’ = 2, ‘ARR’ = [7, 5], ‘QUERIES’ = [[1, 8], [2, 1, 3]].

Output: 6
In this case, the array ‘ARR’ after the first query will be ‘ARR’ = [7, 5, 8].
In the second query, the average will be = the sum of hits from day 1 to day 3 divided by 3
i.e. (7+5+8)/3 = 20/3 = 6.6666… when rounded gives 6. Hence the output will be 6.
