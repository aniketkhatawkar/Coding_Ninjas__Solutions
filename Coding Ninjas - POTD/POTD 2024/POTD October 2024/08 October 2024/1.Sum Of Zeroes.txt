Sum Of Zeroes

Problem statement
You are given a binary matrix (it contains only 0s and 1s) with dimensions ‘N * M’. 
You need to find and return the sum of coverages of all zeros of the given matrix.

Coverage for a particular 0 is defined as the total number of ‘1s’ around it (i.e., immediate left, immediate right, immediate up, and immediate bottom positions).
