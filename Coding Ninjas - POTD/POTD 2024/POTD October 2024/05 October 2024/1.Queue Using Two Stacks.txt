Queue Using Two Stacks

Problem statement
You will be given ‘Q’ queries. You need to implement a queue using two stacks according to those queries. Each query will belong to one of these three types:

1 ‘X’: Enqueue element ‘X’  into the end of the nth queue. Returns true after the element is enqueued.

2: Dequeue the element at the front of the nth queue. Returns -1 if the queue is empty, otherwise, returns the dequeued element.
Note:
Enqueue means adding an element to the end of the queue, while Dequeue means removing the element from the front of the queue.
