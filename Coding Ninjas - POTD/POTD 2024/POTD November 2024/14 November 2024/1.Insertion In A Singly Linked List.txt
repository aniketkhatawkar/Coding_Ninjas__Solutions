Insertion In A Singly Linked List

Problem statement
You are given a Singly Linked List of ‘N’ positive integers. Your task is to add a node having the value ‘VAL’ at position ‘POS’ in the linked list.

Note:
Assume that the Indexing for the linked list starts from 0.
EXAMPLE:
Input: ‘N’ = 5, 'LIST' = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1], ‘VAL’ = 2, ‘POS’ = 1.

Output: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 

Here in the given list we can see that the node having value 2 is inserted at position 1.
