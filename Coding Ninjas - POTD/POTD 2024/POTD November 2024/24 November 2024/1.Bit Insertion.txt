Bit Insertion

Problem statement
You are given two 32 bit positive integers 'X' and 'Y', and two positions 'A' and 'B'. 
Your task is to insert 'Y' into 'X' starting from A’th position to B’th position both inclusive.

Inserting a number is resetting all the bits of 'X' from position 'A' to position 'B' and then writing 'Y' in 'X' starting from index 'A'.

Note : Bit positions are 0 indexed.


For example :
X = 1536 and Y = 7, A = 1 and B = 5,
X is base 2 = 11000000000, Y in base 2 = 0111
First, we clear all the bits of X from index 1 to index 5 then wrote Y in X starting from A.
After inserting Y in X starting from position result will be 11000001110
