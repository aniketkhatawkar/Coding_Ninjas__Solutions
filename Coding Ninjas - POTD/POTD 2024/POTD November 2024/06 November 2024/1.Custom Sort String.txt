Custom Sort String

Problem statement
You are provided with the two strings named X and Y respectively. 
Y has its own specific order and has no repeating characters. 
Your task is to arrange the characters of the first string i.e. X in such a way that the order of characters in X is exactly the same as in Y, 
which means if ‘d’ occurs after ‘c’ in Y then it should also occur after ‘c’ in X ( obviously if X has ‘d’ and ‘c’ as characters in it ). All you have to do is, convert string X in the specific order with respect to string Y.

Note :

Both the strings have only lowercase English alphabets. 
There may be more than one correct solution, you have to return any one of the possible solutions.
