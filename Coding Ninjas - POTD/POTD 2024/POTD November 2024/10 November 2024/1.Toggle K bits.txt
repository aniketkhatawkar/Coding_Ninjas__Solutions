Toggle K bits

Problem statement
You are given a 32-bit integer ‘N’. Your task is to toggle the rightmost ‘K’ bits in the given integer and return the new integer.

For Example :
If ‘N’ = 12 and ‘K’ = 2:
The binary representation of 12 is ‘1100’, after toggling rightmost 2 bits, it becomes ‘1111’ i.e. 15. Hence, the answer is 15.
