Convert String

Problem statement
You are given a string 'STR'. You have to convert the first alphabet of each word in a string to UPPER CASE.

For example:

If the given string 'STR' = ”I am a student of the third year” so you have to transform this string to ”I Am A Student Of The Third Year"
Note:

'STR' will contains only space and alphabets both uppercase and lowercase. The words will be separated by space.
