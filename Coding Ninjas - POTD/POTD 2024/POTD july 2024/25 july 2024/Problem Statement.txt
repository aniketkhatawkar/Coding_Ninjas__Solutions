Toss Strange Coins

Problem statement
You are given ‘N’ coins, and an array ‘PROB’. 
These coins are “strange” because the probability of getting the head or tail is not ‘1/2’, 
the probability of getting a head face is denoted by the ‘PROB’ array. 
You are also given a positive integer ‘TARGET’, denoting the number of the coins facing heads you want if you toss every coin exactly once. 
Your task is to find out the “probability” of doing so.
