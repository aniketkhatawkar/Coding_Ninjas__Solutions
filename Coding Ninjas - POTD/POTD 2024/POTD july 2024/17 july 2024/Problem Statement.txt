Concatenate The Largest Digit

Problem statement
You are given three non-zero numbers ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’. 
The task is to find the number formed by concatenating the largest digit from each of these numbers in the order of ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’.

For Example :
A = 5678, B = 45 and C = 769
The largest digit in ‘A’ is ‘8’, ‘B’ is ‘5’, and ‘C’ is ‘9’. 
The new number formed by concatenating the largest digit from each of these numbers is ‘859’. 
So, the answer is ‘859’.
