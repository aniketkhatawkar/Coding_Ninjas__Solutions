Second Most Repeated Word

Problem statement
You are given an array of strings ‘ARR’. 
You have to find out the second most repeated word in the array ‘ARR’. 
It is guaranteed every string occurs a unique number of times in the array. 
If there is only one unique string in the array, return an empty string.

Example:-
N = 5
S = [‘aaa’, ‘bbb’, ‘ccc’, ‘aaa’, ‘bbb’, ‘aaa’]

ANSWER:- The answer should be ‘bbb’ as it is repeated 2 times 
and is the second most repeated word in the array [after the word ‘aaa’ which is repeated 3 times].
