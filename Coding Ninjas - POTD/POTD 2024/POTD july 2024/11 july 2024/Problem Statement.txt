First Negative Integer In Every Window Of Size K
 
Problem statement
You have been given an array of integers 'ARR' and an integer ‘K’. 
You need to find the first negative integer in each window of size ‘K’.

Note :
If a window does not contain a negative integer, then print 0 for that window.
For example :
If N = 9, arr[ ] = {-10, 20, -30, -40, 50, 60, -70, 80, 90} and K = 3

then the output will be
{-10 -30 -30 -40 -70 -70 -70}
