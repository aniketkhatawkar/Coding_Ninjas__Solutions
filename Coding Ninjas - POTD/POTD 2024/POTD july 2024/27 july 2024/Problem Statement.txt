Count Number Of Rounds

Problem statement
Given an integer ‘N’, you need to make the maximum possible number of moves where each move consists of choosing a positive integer ‘X’ > 1, 
such that ‘N’ is divisible by ‘X’ and replacing ‘N’ with ‘N/X’.

When ‘N’ becomes equal to 1 and there are no more possible valid moves. 
You need to stop and your score is equal to the number of moves made.

Given ‘N’ is of the form a! / b! ( i.e. factorial of ‘a’ divided by factorial of ‘b’) for some positive integer ‘a’ and ‘b’ (a ≥ b).

You need to find and return the maximum possible score you can achieve.
