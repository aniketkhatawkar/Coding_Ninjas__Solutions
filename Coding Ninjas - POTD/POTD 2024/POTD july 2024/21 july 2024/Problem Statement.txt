N Queue Using Array

Problem statement
You will be given ‘N’ queries. You need to implement ‘N’ queues using an array according to those queries. Each query will belong to one of these two types:

1 ‘X’ N: Enqueue element ‘X’  into the end of the nth queue. Returns true if the element is enqueued, otherwise false.

2 N: Dequeue the element at the front of the nth queue. Returns -1 if the queue is empty, otherwise, returns the dequeued element.
Note:
Please note that Enqueue means adding an element to the end of the queue, while Dequeue means removing the element from the front of the queue.
