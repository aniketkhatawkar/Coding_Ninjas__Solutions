Subtract The Product And Sum Of Digits Of An Integer

Problem statement
You are given an integer number ‘N’, and your task is to return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

Note:
You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
For Example :
Input: N = 234
Output: 15 
Explanation: 
Product of digits = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 
Sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 
Result = 24 - 9 = 15
