 Find Nth Root Of M

Problem statement
You are given two positive integers 'n' and 'm'. You have to return the 'nth' root of 'm', i.e. 'm(1/n)'. If the 'nth root is not an integer, return -1.

Note:
'nth' root of an integer 'm' is a number, which, when raised to the power 'n', gives 'm' as a result.

Example:
Input: ‘n’ = 3, ‘m’ = 27

Output: 3

Explanation: 
3rd Root of 27 is 3, as (3)^3 equals 27.
