Ninja And The Triangle

Problem statement
Ninja has been given ‘N’ stars. 
Ninja has to make a triangle using these stars. 
The ‘i’th’ level of a triangle contains a ‘i’ number of stars.

Can you help Ninja to make a triangle as large as possible using these stars?

For example:
Let the number of stars is 6.

Then we can make a triangle of maximum height 3.
Note:
If the number of stars is 7 in the above example, 
then also the maximum height of the triangle is 3. 
This is because to make a triangle of height 4 we need at least 10 stars. 
So in this case (N = 7) to we will return 3.
