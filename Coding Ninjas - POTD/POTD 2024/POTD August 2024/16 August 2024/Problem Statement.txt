Find Division Upto Given Decimal Places

Problem statement
You are given three integers ‘X’, ‘Y’ and ‘N’. 
Find the value of division X / Y up to ‘N’ decimal places.

You should return a string that represents the value X / Y up to ‘N’ decimal places. This string must have ‘N’ digits after decimals. 
You don’t need to round off the result to ‘N’ decimal places, just find the first ‘N’ places after decimals.

Note:

1. It is guaranteed that division X / Y is always finite.
Example:

Consider X = 5, Y = 4 and N = 5, then you should return “1.25000”. 
Note, here we add 3 trailing zeros so that it has exactly 5 digits after decimals.
