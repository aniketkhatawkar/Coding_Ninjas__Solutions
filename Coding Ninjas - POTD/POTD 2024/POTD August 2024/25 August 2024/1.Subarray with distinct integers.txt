Subarray with distinct integers

Problem statement
You are given an array/list 'ARR' consisting of 'N' integers and an integer 'B'. 
A non-empty subarray of 'ARR' is good if it contains exactly 'B' distinct integers.

Your task is to return the number of good subarrays in the given array/list.

Example:

For 'ARR' = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4] and 'B' = 3, 
one of the good subarrays which contains three distinct integers is [1, 2, 1, 3]. 
Note:

An array 'C' is a subarray of array 'D' 
if it can be obtained by deletion of several elements(possibly zero) from the beginning and the end from array 'D'.
