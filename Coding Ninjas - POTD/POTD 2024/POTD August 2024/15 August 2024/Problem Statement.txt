Flip The Bits

Problem statement
Ninja has a binary string ‘S’ of length ‘N’. 
Initially, all the characters in a string are ‘1’, i.e.

S[i] = ‘1’ for each 1 <= ‘i’ <= ‘N’.
An operation is defined as choosing a number between 1 to 4, 
and doing the following steps accordingly.

1. If the chosen number is 1, then flip all the characters in string.

2. If the chosen number is 2, then flip all the characters at odd indexes.

3. If the chosen number is 3, then flip all the characters at even indexes.

4. If the chosen number is 4, then flip all the characters at (3k + 1) indexes. 
You need to find out that after performing operations exactly ‘M’ number of times, how many distinct final strings can be there.

Note :
1. A binary string is a string in which all characters are either ‘1’ or ‘0’.

2. Flipping a character means that if the character is ‘1’ then change it to 0, or if it is ‘0’ then change it to ‘1’.

Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :
Test Case 1:
We can get these final strings [ ‘000’, ‘010’, ‘101’, ‘011’ ]  by doing four types of operations.

Test Case 2:
We can get ‘1’ by doing the 1st type of operation twice and ‘0’ by doing the 1st type of operation followed by the 3rd type of operation.

2 10  
4 3
