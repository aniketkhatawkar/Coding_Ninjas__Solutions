Campus Cycles

Problem statement
A school campus is represented as a 2D grid. 
The campus has N students and M cycles, and the number of students are less than or equal to the number of cycles. 
Each student and cycle is represented as a 2D coordinate (X, Y) on this grid.

Our goal is to assign exactly one cycle to each student. Among the available cycles and students, 
we choose the (student, cycle) pair with the shortest Manhattan distance between each other, and assign the cycle to that student. 
If there are multiple (student, cycle) pairs with the same shortest Manhattan distance, we choose the pair with the smallest student index; 
if there are multiple ways to do that, we choose the pair with the smallest cycle index. We repeat this process until a cycle is assigned to each student.

Given the description of the school campus, your task is to find the index (0-based) of the cycle that is assigned to each student.

The Manhattan distance between two points P1 and P2 is defined as D = |P1.X - P2.X| + |P1.Y - P2.Y| 
where X, Y represents the location of a point in both horizontal as well as vertical direction respectively from the origin(0,0).

Explanation 1:
For the first test case, 
Distance of Student 0 from Cycle 0  = |1-0| + |2-0| = 3
Distance of Student 0 from Cycle 1  = |3-0| + |3-0| = 6
Distance of Student 1 from Cycle 0  = |1-2| + |2-1| = 2
Distance of Student 0 from Cycle 0  = |1-0| + |2-0| = 3
Student 1 grabs Cycle 0 as it is closest (without ties), and Student 0 is assigned Cycle 1. So the output is [1, 0].

For the second test case, 
Distance of Student 0 from Cycle 0  = |2-1| + |2-1| = 2
Distance of Student 0 from Cycle 1  = |2-1| + |1-1| = 1
Distance of Student 1 from Cycle 0  = |2-2| + |2-1| = 1
Distance of Student 1 from Cycle 1  = |2-1| + |2-1| = 0
Student 1 grabs Cycle 1 as it is closest and Student 0 is assigned Cycle 0. So the output is [1, 0]
