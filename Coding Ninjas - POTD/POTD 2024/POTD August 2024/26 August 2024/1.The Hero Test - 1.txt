The Hero Test - 1

Problem statement
Ninja wants the hero certificate to get the support of local police and government to help the people. 
But to get the hero certificate he needs to clear an exam.

The exam consists of ‘N’ questions from ‘1’ to ‘N’. To clear the exam Ninja needs to solve in a particular order. 
He needs to leave one question after solving one question(assume that after ‘N’th question he will come back to the first question). 
He will perform this action till all questions are solved. Help Ninja in exams by telling him the order.

For Example:
If there are ‘5’ questions then the order will be:
“ 2 4 1 5 3 ”
