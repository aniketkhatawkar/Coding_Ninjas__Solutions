Amicable Pair

Problem statement
You are given two integers ‘X’ and ‘Y’. 
Your task is to find if the given integers are an amicable pair.

A pair of numbers are called Amicable if the sum of the proper divisor of each number is equal to the other number. 
Print ‘True’ if the numbers form amicable pair otherwise print ‘False’

A positive proper divisor is a positive divisor of a number, 
excluding itself. For example, 1, 2, and 3 are positive proper divisors of 6, but 6 itself is not.

For example:

Let 'X' = 220 and 'Y' = 284 form an amicable pair as the sum of the proper divisor of one is equal to the other.
