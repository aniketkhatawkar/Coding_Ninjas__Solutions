Gary and multiplication

Problem statement
Gary has recently learned about priority queues and is quite excited about them. He has asked his teacher for an interesting problem. 
So, his teacher came up with a simple problem.

The problem is that he now has an integer array 'ARR'. For every index i, he wants to find the product of the largest, 
second largest and the third largest integer in the range [0, i] given that array has 0 based indexing.

You have to return the list as required.

Note: Two numbers can be the same value-wise but they should be distinct index-wise.

Example:
If the array is [2, 3, 3, 4], the answer should be:-

-1 
-1
18 (3 * 3 * 2)
36 (4 * 3 * 3)
