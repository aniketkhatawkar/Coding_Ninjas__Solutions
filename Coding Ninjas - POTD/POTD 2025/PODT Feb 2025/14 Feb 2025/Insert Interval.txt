Insert Interval

Problem statement
You are given a list of ‘N’ non-overlapping intervals (each interval can be represented using two integers ‘start’ and ‘end’), sorted in ascending order (based on ‘start’ values). Your task is to insert a given interval in the list, such that all the intervals are present in sorted order.

In case the given interval overlaps with other intervals, merge all necessary intervals to produce a list containing only non-overlapping intervals.

Example:

Let’s say the list of intervals is: [[1,3], [5,7], [8,12]] and we need to insert the interval [4,6] into the list. [4,6] must be inserted in the second position. After insertion, since [4,6] overlaps with [5,7], we merge them into one interval [4,7]. So, our resulting list is:  [[1,3], [4,7], [8,12]]
