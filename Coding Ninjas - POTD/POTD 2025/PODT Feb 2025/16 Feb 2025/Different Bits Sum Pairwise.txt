Different Bits Sum Pairwise

Problem statement
You are given an arbitrary array ‘arr’ consisting of 'N' non-negative integers. You need to find the sum of bit differences of all the pairs that can be formed in the given array.

In simple words, let us define f(x, y) as the count of different bits at the same position in the binary representations of two integers, x and y.

You need to find the summation of f over all possible values of x and y in the input array I.e sum( f(arr[i], arr[j])) for all 0 <= i < N and 0 <= j < N.

For Example :
f(2, 3) = 1, as 2 → 0010 and 3 → 0011, only the last bit is different in both the numbers, hence f(2, 3) is 1.
Note :
As the final answer may be very large, return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
