Infix To Postfix

Problem statement
You are given a string 'exp' which is a valid infix expression.



Convert the given infix expression to postfix expression.



Note:
Infix notation is a method of writing mathematical expressions in which operators are placed between operands. 

For example, "3 + 4" represents the addition of 3 and 4.

Postfix notation is a method of writing mathematical expressions in which operators are placed after the operands. 

For example, "3 4 +" represents the addition of 3 and 4.

Expression contains digits, lower case English letters, ‘(’, ‘)’, ‘+’, ‘-’, ‘*’, ‘/’, ‘^’. 


Example:
Input: exp = ‘3+4*8’

Output: 348*+

Explanation:
Here multiplication is performed first and then the addition operation. Hence postfix expression is  3 4 8 * +.
