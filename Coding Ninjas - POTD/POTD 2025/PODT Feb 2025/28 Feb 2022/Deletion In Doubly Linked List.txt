Deletion In Doubly Linked List

Problem statement
You are given a Doubly Linked List of ‘N’ positive integers. Your task is to delete a node at position ‘POS’ in the linked list.

Note:
Assume that the Indexing for the linked list starts from 0.
EXAMPLE:
Input: ‘N’ = 5, 'LIST' = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1], ‘POS’ = 1.

Output: 1 < - > 2 < - > 3 < - > 4 

Here in the given list, we can see that the node at position 1 is deleted.
