Find the Good Matrix

Problem statement
You have given a 2-dimensional array ‘ARR’ with ‘N’ rows and ‘M’ columns in which each element contains only two values,i.e., 0 and 1. Your task is to convert the given matrix into the Good matrix in which if an element is 0, you need to set all elements values present in its entire row and column to 0.

For example:

Consider ARR = [[1 , 0 , 1] ,
                [1 , 1 , 1] , 
                [1 , 1 , 1]], 
the Good matrix after updating the given matrix as described in the question is  
                [[0 , 0 , 0] , 
                 [1 , 0 , 1] , 
                 [1 , 0 , 1]]. 
Since ARR[0][1] is 0, we need to set all element’s values present in 0-th row and 1-th column to 0.
Note :

You do not need to print the matrix. Just change in the given input.
