Round Robin

Problem statement
Round Robin is a CPU Scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slice / quantum in a cyclic manner.

You should be aware of the following terms before proceeding:

Arrival time: Time at which the process arrives.

Burst time: The time the process takes for its execution. 

Completion time: Time at which the process completes its execution.

Turn Around time: Time difference between the Completion time and the Arrival time.

Waiting time: Time difference between the Turn Around time and the Burst time.
You are given time slice / quantum and a list of processes where 'PROCESS[ i ]' denotes the Burst time of the process 'i'. Your task is to perform Round Robin scheduling and print a list of Waiting time where (i)th index of your list denotes the waiting time for 'PROCESS[ i ]'.

Note:

You can consider Arrival time for every process to be 0.
