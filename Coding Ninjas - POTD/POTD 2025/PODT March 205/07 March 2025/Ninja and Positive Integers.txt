Ninja and Positive Integers

Problem statement
Ninja likes to play with positive integers. One day he found a positive integer ‘N’ and started to think about 3 positive integers which will sum up to ‘N’ but the LCM of these integers should be less than or equal to ‘N’/2, i.e.,

a1 + a2 + a3 = N
LCM(a1, a2, a3) <= N/2
Since this task is too simple for Ninja, he asked you to find the three numbers satisfying the above conditions.

For Example:
Let N = 4, then we can choose 1, 1, and 2. The sum of these integers is 4 which is equal to ‘N’ and their LCM is 2 which is <= N/2.
