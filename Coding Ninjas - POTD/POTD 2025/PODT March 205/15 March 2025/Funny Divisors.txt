Funny Divisors

Problem statement
Ninja is bored with his previous game of numbers, so now he is playing with divisors.

He is given 'N' numbers, and his task is to return the sum of all numbers which is divisible by 2 or 3.

Let the number given to him be - 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. As 2, 3, and 6 is divisible by either 2 or 3 we return 2 + 3 + 6 = 11.
