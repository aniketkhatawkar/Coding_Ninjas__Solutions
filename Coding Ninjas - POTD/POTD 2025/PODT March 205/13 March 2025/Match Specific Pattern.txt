Problem statement
You have been given two sorted arrays/lists of closed intervals ‘INTERVAL1’ and ‘INTERVAL2’. A closed interval [x, y] with x < y denotes the set of real numbers ‘z’ with x <= z <= y.

Now, your task is to find the intersection of these two interval lists.

The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of [0, 2] and [1, 3] is [1, 2].


Note :

1. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint.
2. 'INTERVAL1' and 'INTERVAL2' don't contain duplicate intervals.
3. If there is no intersection present in 'INTERVAL1' and 'INTERVAL2' return an empty array/list.
For example, if INTERVAL1 = [[0, 5], [7, 9], [10, 11]] and INTERVAL2 = [[0, 2], [3, 7], [12, 15]], then the intersection array/list will be [[0, 2], [3, 5], [7, 7]].
