Modify Linked list

Problem statement
You are given a linked list containing N nodes where each node is associated with a certain value. Return a linked list as follows: If the input linked list is 1-->2-->3-->4, then the output should be 1-->4-->2-->3. And if the input is 1-->2-->3-->4-->5, then the output should be 1-->5-->2-->4-->3.

In other words, if the original linked list is first -> second -> third -> ……….->thirdlast -> secondlast -> last, then the modified linked list would be first -> last -> second -> second_last -> ...

Note

1. All the node values are positive.

2. The size of the linked list is greater than 1.

3. The end of the linked list is represented by -1.
