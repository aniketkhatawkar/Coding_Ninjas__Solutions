Minimum Difference in an Array

Problem statement
Given an array of integers, print the minimum of the absolute difference of all possible pairs of elements.

Example :
N = 5
ARR = [ 3, -6, 7, -7, 0 ]
Out of all pairs, (-7,-6) have a difference of ‘1’, and no other pair has less difference. So ‘ANS’ is ‘1’.
