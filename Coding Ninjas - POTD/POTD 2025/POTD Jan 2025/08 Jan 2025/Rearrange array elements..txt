Rearrange array elements.

Problem statement
Given an array ‘A’ having ‘N’ integers and an integer ‘m’. You need to rearrange the array elements such that after re-arrangement difference of array elements with ‘m’ should be in a sorted fashion.

If the difference between any two array elements and ‘m’ is the same, then the element which comes first in the given array will be placed first in the re-arranged array.

For Example
If we have A =  [3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 6]  and m = 5.
Difference of array elements with m : [2, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1].
Array after rearrangement : [5, 6, 3, 7, 2, 9].
