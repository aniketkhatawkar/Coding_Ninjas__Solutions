Power Of 2
Problem statement
You are given an integer ‘N’. We can reorder the digits in any order (including the original order) such that the leading digit is not zero.

Return true if and only if we can do this so that the resulting number is a power of two. Else, return false.

For Example :

Given :-
‘N’ = 218
Then the answer will be true because it can be rearranged to 128, which is 2 raised to the power of 7.
