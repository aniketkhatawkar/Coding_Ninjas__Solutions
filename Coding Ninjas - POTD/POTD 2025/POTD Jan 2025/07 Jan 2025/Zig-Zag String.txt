Zig-Zag String

Problem statement
You are given a string ‘STR’ of size ‘N’ and an integer ‘M’ (the number of rows in the zig-zag pattern of ‘STR’). Your task is to return the string formed by concatenating all ‘M’ rows when string ‘STR’ is written in a row-wise zig-zag pattern.

Example:
N = 12, M = 3 and STR = ‘CODINGNINJAS’

There are three rows (‘M = 3’) in the zig-zag pattern. Row one contains ‘CNN’, row two contains ‘OIGIJS’, and row three contains ‘DNA’. After concatenating the three rows, we get the string ‘CNNOIGIJSDNA’. So, the answer is ‘CNNOIGIJSDNA’.
Note:
1. The string ‘STR’ consists of capital letters only (i.e., characters from ‘A-Z’).
