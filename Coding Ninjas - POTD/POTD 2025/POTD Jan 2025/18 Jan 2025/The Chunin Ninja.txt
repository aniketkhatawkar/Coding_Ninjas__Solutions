The Chunin Ninja

Problem statement
You are the Supreme Ninja Warrior on a visit to Ninja Class, and class can be represented as a rectangular matrix ‘ARR’ of ‘N’ rows and ‘M’ columns.

Each Ninja has a skill level, and each element in matrix ‘ARR’ represents the skill level of the Ninja present in the class. More formally, ‘ARR[i][j]’ represents the skill level of Ninja sitting in the ‘jth’ column of the ‘ith’ row.

A ninja is said to be ‘Chunin’ if he has maximum skill among all Ninjas in his column and minimum skill level among all Ninjas in his row.

Can you find all the ‘Chunin’ Ninjas present in the class?

Example :
N = 3 M = 3
ARR = [ [3, 4, 5], [2, 7, 6] , [1, 2, 4] ]

Ninja at Position (0,0) has maximum skill in ‘0th’ column and minimum skill in ‘0th’ row, it is the only Chunin Ninja.
So, we return [ 3 ] as our ‘ANS’.
