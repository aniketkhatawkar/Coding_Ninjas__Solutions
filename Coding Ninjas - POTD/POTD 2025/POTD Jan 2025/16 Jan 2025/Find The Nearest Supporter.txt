 Find The Nearest Supporter

Problem statement
There are contestants standing in a row. Each contestant is assigned a rating, which is an integer. A contestant supports all those whose rating is greater than their rating.

Now for each contestant standing in the row, you need to tell the rating of its closest supporter on the left.

If no supporter is there, store -1 in that place.

For Example
Consider the row : [ 3, 1, 5, 12, 10], with 1-based indexing -
For index 3, there would be 2 supporters, index 1 and index 2, but index 2 is closest, hence for index 3, we will store ‘1’ (Rating of contestant). 
For index 5, we will store ‘5’(at index 3).
