Modular Node

Problem statement
You are given a singly linked list containing ‘N’ nodes, where every node in the linked list contains a pointer “next” which points to the next node in the list and having integer values. You are also given an integer ‘K’.

You recently studied modular operation and you wanted to find out the last node in the linked list such that ‘x%K’ = 0 , where ‘x’ is the position of the node from the beginning.

Return the last node that satisfies the above property.

Example :
N = 7 , K = 3
Linked List = 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5 -> 7

Explanation : 

The first node has ‘x%K’ = 1%3 = 1.
The second node has ‘x%K’ = 2%3 = 2.
The third node has ‘x%K’ = 3%3 = 0.
The fourth node has ‘x%K’ = 4%3 = 1.
The fifth node has ‘x%K’ = 5%3 = 2.
The sixth node has ‘x%K’ = 6%3 = 0.
The seventh node has ‘x%K’ = 7%3 = 1.
So, the last node which has ‘x%k’ = 0 is the sixth node with value 5.
