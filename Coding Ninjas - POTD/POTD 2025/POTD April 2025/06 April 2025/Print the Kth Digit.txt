Print the Kth Digit

Problem statement
You are given three non-negative integers N, M, and K. Your task is to print the Kth digit from the right in ‘N’ raised to the power ‘M’ that is, in N ^ M.

Note:

1) It is guaranteed that the Kth digit from the right always exists.
2) It is also guaranteed that 'K' is always less than or equal to the number of digits in N ^ M.
3) 'N' and 'M 'can’t be a 0 simultaneously.
