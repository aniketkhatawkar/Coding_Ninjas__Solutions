Count unsorted columns

Problem statement
You are given an array ‘STRINGS’ having ‘N’ number of strings. The strings are assumed to be arranged such that there is one string in one line.

You need to return the number of columns that are not sorted lexicographically.

Note:
The length of all the strings in the array is the same.
For Example:
If the given array is [ “bde”, “dcf”, “gat” ], then it can be assumed to arranged as
bde
dcf 
gat 

Now the ‘0-th’ column (‘b’, ‘d’, ‘e’) and ‘2-th’ column ( ‘e’, ‘f’, ‘t’ ) are lexicographically sorted but the ‘1-st’ column ( ‘d’, ‘c’, ‘a’ ) is not sorted lexicographically. So you need to return 1.
