Problem : Set Matrix Ones
Problem statement
You have been given a non-empty grid ‘MAT’ consisting of only 0s and 1s. Your task is to modify it in such a way that if a cell has value 1 (MAT[i][j] == 1), then all the cells of the i-th row and j-th column should be changed to 1.

For Example
If the given grid is this:
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 1]

Then the modified grid will be
[0, 0, 1],
[1, 1, 1]
