Absolute difference in an array

Problem statement
You are given an array/list 'ARR' consisting of 'N' non - negative integers. Your task is to return the running absolute difference of the elements at even and odd index positions separately.

The index of the first element in the array is considered to be zero that is 0 - based indexing is considered for calculating the parity of the index.

Example:

Consider the array - [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
The elements at even positions will be 1, 3, 5. The running absolute difference of elements will be - 
|1 - 3| = 2 , |2 -5| = 3. Hence our answer will be 3.

The elements at odd positions will be 2, 4, 6. The running absolute difference of elements will be - 
|2 - 4| = 2 , |2 - 6| = 4. Hence our answer will be 4.
