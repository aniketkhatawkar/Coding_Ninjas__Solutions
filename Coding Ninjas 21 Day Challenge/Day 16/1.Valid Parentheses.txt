Valid Parentheses

Problem statement
You're given a string 'S' consisting of "{", "}", "(", ")", "[" and "]" .

Return true if the given string 'S' is balanced, else return false.

For example:
'S' = "{}()".

There is always an opening brace before a closing brace i.e. '{' before '}', '(' before ').
So the 'S' is Balanced.
